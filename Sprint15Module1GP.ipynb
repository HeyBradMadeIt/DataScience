[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) is a famous blog post by Andrej Karpathy on this topic, worth reading.<br><br>\n",

        "A language model is simply a model that, given some text, predicts the most likely next word, or character.<br><br>\n",

        "The data set already has the answers!\n",
        "\n",
        "Another interesting application of LSTMs is to text classification problems such as the sentiment classification problem we encountered in Unit 4, Sprint 1. Since LSTMs can learn contextual information about sequences of words, they can learn for example, that \"the service is not so great\" does not indicate a positive sentiment.\n",

Transformers give seq2seq models the capacity to pay attention to specific portions of the input sequence, the most relevent portion in order to make a prediction.

What the Democrats are doing to our president, to the office and to the people of this country is disgusting.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Trump and his allies have aimed increasingly caustic language at Schiff in recent days, the attacks have been echoed by supporters on social media who often take the message a step further \\u2014 invoking physical violence against one of the most prominent Democrats overseeing the inquiry that now threatens Trump\\u2019s presidency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe chain reaction represents a new test of the power of weaponized language to inspire physical violence. Over the summer, Trump faced criticism for employing anti-immigrant rhetoric that was parroted by the man accused of fatally shooting22 people at a Walmart in El Paso in August. In the fall of 2018, an avid Trump supporter mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats.\\n\\nWhat many of the violent, anti-Schiff messages have in common is the inspiration they appear to draw from the president\\u2019s words, or from the words of his associates and allies in Congress and conservative media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA tweet from Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\\u2019s personal lawyer, arguing that Schiff should be \\u201csuspended\\u201d was reposted by a user with nearly 50,000 followers who envisioned the congressman\\u2019s public hanging in a football stadium. The post remained live as of Sunday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA tweet from Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) describing Schiff as a \\u201cproven liar\\u201d who should be \\u201cheld accountable\\u201d was reposted by a user with thousands of followers and a longing for the \\u201cgood old days when traitors like Schiff would be hanged by the neck until dead.\\u201d It also remained live.\\n\\nA tweet from Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, was reposted by a user with only a small following who envisioned Schiff sitting in front of a firing squad. The post was taken down.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeither Giuliani nor Schlapp responded to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond. But a spokeswoman for Scalise defended his rhetoric, saying the Louisiana congressman \\u2014 among the victims of a shooting at congressional baseball practice in 2017 \\u2014 knows firsthand the consequences of extreme language.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cAs someone who was targeted by a leftist motivated by violent rhetoric towards Republicans, Whip Scalise is well aware of the dangers of that kind of rhetoric,\\u201d said Lauren Fine, the spokeswoman. \\u201cAdam Schiff has a detailed history of using irresponsible, false and accusatory rhetoric throughout Trump\\u2019s presidency, which is what this tweet simply documents in Schiff\\u2019s own words.\\u201d\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Schiff said the security of the congressman and his staff is \\u201calways a top priority,\\u201d declining to go into more detail about specific threats. A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police said authorities consult with individual congressional offices on \\u201csecurity-related matters\\u201d but declined to discuss precautions around the high-stakes impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe most graphic and specific threats against Schiff were quickly scrubbed from Twitter, whose policies prohibit threats of violence as well as the \\u201cglorification of violence.\\u201d At least one additional tweet was removed after it was flagged for the company by The Washington Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut much of the vitriol remained. And the violent language also reached beyond Twitter, echoing on platforms such as Facebook and 4chan, a sprawling online agora where hate speech and violent threats are routine. A link to an article about Trump\\u2019s accusation of treason against Schiff appearing on a Facebook page called \\u201cUSA Patriots for Donald Trump,\\u201d which boasts nearly 2 million followers, drew a slew of comments about the congressman being hanged.\\n\\nThe heightened focus on Schiff reflects the extent to which the former prosecutor and longtime Los Angeles-area congressman has become the b\\u00eate noire of the Trump movement since becoming the de facto head of the investigation of Trump\\u2019s efforts to enlist Ukraine\\u2019s help in damaging former vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. Schiff has come under criticism from Trump and congressional Republicans as they seek to delegitimize the inquiry by portraying it as tainted by political bias. The nub of the criticism of Schiff is that he spoofed the president\\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart during a congressional hearing and that he made misleading statements about the nature of his prior knowledge of the initial whistleblower complaint.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnalysts say the pattern resulting in the violent rhetoric targeting Schiff makes evident the radicalizing effect of social media, which Trump uses to incite his followers against his perceived enemies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cWhole online communities are forming around these sentiments, like MAGA,\\u201d said Amarnath Amarasingam, an expert on political violence and an assistant professor at Queen\\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, referring to Trump\\u2019s campaign slogan. \\u201cThe online social movement of Trump supporters is very real, and a cohort of that movement has come out and said they\\u2019re ready to take up arms when needed. This is something a few of us have been worried about for some time.\\u201d\\n\\nThe web is where the president\\u2019s hold over his supporters comes into sharpest focus, the extremism researcher said. On Twitter, his opinions \\u2014 and his disparaging views of other politicians \\u2014 are received uncritically, Amarasingam added, giving Trump enormous power over his followers and \\u201csetting the stage for violence.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome Trump critics have also used sharp language online, including accusing the president of treason and noting the maximum penalty: death.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death,\\u201d former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination, said last month on MSNBC of Trump\\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. The comment was tweeted by a reporter, and retweeted by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.).\\n\\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz,), who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt in 2011, said the responsibility of politicians to \\u201cseek the truth\\u201d and \\u201ctreat their fellow Americans with respect\\u201d was heightened \\u201cin charged times.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGlobally, public figures are not living up to that responsibility, said Jacob Davey, senior research manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a U.K.-based think tank dedicated to countering extremism and polarization. The result is increasing online radicalization \\u2014 not just in the Middle East and Northern Africa, long the focus of extremism research, but also in the heart of the West.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSocial media, he said, \\u201chas undoubtedly made engaging in such behavior easier than ever before, with users escaping the legal and social repercussions of their actions.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s ability to craft an alternate universe for his supporters, in which he is the victim of lawless Democrats, rests on an unregulated online ecosystem, where fake news travels faster than the truth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpanbauer, who became dissatisfied with Obama during his first term and voted for his Republican challenger in 2012, said she gets most of her news on Twitter and YouTube. Among those she trusts are Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity (\\u201cof course\\u201d) and Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch (\\u201cthank God for Tom Fitton\\u201d).\\n\\nTrump, she said, channels her anger at Washington, while speaking directly to his supporters. \\u201cIt\\u2019s wonderful, really, what Trump does on Twitter,\\u201d said Spanbauer, who has worked in retail and sales and struggles, along with her husband, to stay above the federal poverty line.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBeneath her verdict on Schiff\\u2019s fate, which she acknowledges was hyperbolic, lies a firm conviction that the congressman is guilty of treason.\\n\\nThe impeachment inquiry, she said, is a \\u201csupreme insult to our country.\\u201d Those leading it \\u201cshould be held accountable to the length of the law,\\u201d she added. \\u201cIt\\u2019s treason. It\\u2019s treason.\\u201d\",\n          \"At the center of the bloody rampage unfolding in the \\u201cChurch of Fake News\\u201d is a man dressed in a dark pinstripe suit. President Trump\\u2019s head is superimposed on his body.\\n\\nThe graphic images are from a fake video that was shown during a pro-Trump conference last week at the president\\u2019s hotel and golf resort near Miami, according to the New York Times, which first reported on the video\\u2019s existence Sunday night. The clip has since drawn intense backlash from journalists and public figures who have decried it as \\u201cvile and horrific\\u201d and an \\u201cincitement of violence.\\u201d Many of the news organizations and people featured in the video have been publicly targeted by Trump, who is frequently criticized for his inflammatory remarks and anti-media rhetoric.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cThis video isn\\u2019t funny,\\u201d tweeted former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\\u2019Rourke. \\u201cIt will get people killed.\\u201d\\n\\nAt a conference of Trump supporters, they played a video of our president murdering journalists in a church.

The site\\u2019s creator, a user known by his Internet handle, Carpe Donktum, scored an Oval Office meeting in July with Trump, who reportedly welcomed him as a \\u201cgenius.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCarpe Donktum confirmed in a Twitter message Sunday to The Washington Post that \\u201cThe creator of the video is, and will remain a contributor to my site MemeWorld.\\u201d Carpe Donktum declined to identify the video\\u2019s creator citing concerns that the person may face online or in-person harassment.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlex Phillips, organizer of the American Priority Festival and Conference, told the Times the video was played at one point during the three-day event that began Thursday as part of a \\u201cmeme exhibit.\\u201d The violent parody was included in a meme compilation that also featured Trump\\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign logo, according to the Times.\\n\\n\\u201cIt has come to our attention that an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19,\\u201d a statement posted to the conference\\u2019s website said. \\u201cThis video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe statement went on to note that the conference \\u201calways has and always will condemn political violence.\\u201d\\n\\nPhillips told the Times the \\u201cmatter is under review.\\u201d\\n\\nIn a statement to The Post early Monday, the Trump campaign distanced itself from the video.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cThat video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,\\u201d campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.\\n\\nPeople close to Trump, such as former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump Jr., were also scheduled to speak at the conference and told the Times they were not aware of the edited footage.\\n\\nThe video\\u2019s massacre scene opens with the Trump figure walking down the center aisle of a packed church. More than a dozen of the parishioners\\u2019 faces are covered by the logos of major media organizations, ranging from PBS to The Washington Post. Rising out of the pews when Trump passes them, some of the churchgoers appear to be yelling at the president, whose face contorts into a scowl.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the shouting intensifies, Trump abruptly stops walking and turns to face the angry mob. He pulls out a black gun from his jacket\\u2019s inside pocket and shoots a person edited to represent late actor Peter Fonda, who was a vocal critic of the president, in the head from point-blank range.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThen, chaos ensues.\\n\\nTrump takes down Bloomberg, Vox and \\u201cFake News\\u201d in quick succession before shooting Politico. At one point, he grabs someone who represents the Black Lives Matter movement in a chokehold and shoots that person in the head.\\n\\nAfter shooting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Vice News, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\\u2019s neck.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors. He stabs actress and comedian Rosie O\\u2019Donnell and repeatedly punches Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He goes on to shoot MSNBC\\u2019s Mika Brzezinski and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and later assaults Hillary Clinton with a gun.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe video comes to a dramatic end when Trump jams a sharp wooden stake through the head of a person whose face is a CNN logo. A now-grinning Trump appears to survey the carnage as DJ Khaled\\u2019s song, \\u201cAll I Do Is Win,\\u201d plays in the background. A pair of pixelated black sunglasses are lowered onto Trump\\u2019s face.\\n\\nBy late Sunday, \\u201cKingsman\\u201d was trending on Twitter with many expressing outrage at the video and calling on Trump to condemn it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cSadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the President have promoted violence against the media in a video they apparently find entertaining \\u2014 but it is by far and away the worst,\\u201d CNN said in a statement shared on Twitter.\\n\\nThe images in the recent video are \\u201cvile and horrific,\\u201d CNN said, adding, \\u201cThe President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhite House Correspondents\\u2019 Association President Jonathan Karl of ABC News also denounced the video, noting that Trump has been warned that \\u201chis rhetoric could incite violence.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWHCA Statement on video depicting President Trump murdering journalists. pic.twitter.com/52lHFaQjU2 \\u2014 WHCA (@whca) October 14, 2019\\n\\nKarl\\u2019s statement was supported early Monday by Cindy McCain, who tweeted that the images in the video of the president killing the media and her late husband \\u201cviolate every norm our society expects from its leaders.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump has made it a habit to publicly lambaste the media, individual journalists and his critics, leading to heightened concerns about safety. In 2017, the president was widely criticized for tweeting a similarly edited video that showed him body slamming a person with a CNN logo for a face during a pro wrestling match. Earlier this year, Cesar Sayoc, a devoted Trump supporter, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing 13 pipe bombs to high-profile Democrats, several of whom were featured in the recent video, and CNN.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Sunday, journalists and political commentators suggested the church video is further evidence that Trump\\u2019s words have influenced his supporters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cThis is an incitement to violence that didn\\u2019t just come from the dark corners of the Internet \\u2014 it was shown at a pro-Trump conference at one of his resorts,\\u201d tweeted Politico reporter Andrew Desiderio. \\u201cI\\u2019m speechless.\\u201d\\n\\nCNN commentator Ana Navarro-C\\u00e1rdenas wrote, \\u201cTrump has legitimized hate.\\u201d\\n\\nEnablers choose to deny it, but this is the kind of crap Trump peddles & inspires.

In \\u201cJoker,\\u201d Zacharek says Phillips wants viewers to pity Fleck because \\u201che just hasn\\u2019t had enough love,\\u201d but what he\\u2019s done is create a protagonist who could become the \\u201cpatron saint of incels.\\u201d\",\n          \"\\u201cAs you can see, my tweets are pretty passionate,\\u201d Spanbauer, who uses a different name online, said in an interview, adding that she doesn\\u2019t specifically wish anyone physical harm. \\u201cIt hits very close to home for me. What the Democrats are doing to our president, to the office and to the people of this country is disgusting.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Trump and his allies have aimed increasingly caustic language at Schiff in recent days, the attacks have been echoed by supporters on social media who often take the message a step further \\u2014 invoking physical violence against one of the most prominent Democrats overseeing the inquiry that now threatens Trump\\u2019s presidency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe chain reaction represents a new test of the power of weaponized language to inspire physical violence. Over the summer, Trump faced criticism for employing anti-immigrant rhetoric that was parroted by the man accused of fatally shooting22 people at a Walmart in El Paso in August. In the fall of 2018, an avid Trump supporter mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats.\\n\\nWhat many of the violent, anti-Schiff messages have in common is the inspiration they appear to draw from the president\\u2019s words, or from the words of his associates and allies in Congress and conservative media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA tweet from Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\\u2019s personal lawyer, arguing that Schiff should be \\u201csuspended\\u201d was reposted by a user with nearly 50,000 followers who envisioned the congressman\\u2019s public hanging in a football stadium. The post remained live as of Sunday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA tweet from Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) describing Schiff as a \\u201cproven liar\\u201d who should be \\u201cheld accountable\\u201d was reposted by a user with thousands of followers and a longing for the \\u201cgood old days when traitors like Schiff would be hanged by the neck until dead.\\u201d It also remained live.\\n\\nA tweet from Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, was reposted by a user with only a small following who envisioned Schiff sitting in front of a firing squad. The post was taken down.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeither Giuliani nor Schlapp responded to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond. But a spokeswoman for Scalise defended his rhetoric, saying the Louisiana congressman \\u2014 among the victims of a shooting at congressional baseball practice in 2017 \\u2014 knows firsthand the consequences of extreme language.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cAs someone who was targeted by a leftist motivated by violent rhetoric towards Republicans, Whip Scalise is well aware of the dangers of that kind of rhetoric,\\u201d said Lauren Fine, the spokeswoman. \\u201cAdam Schiff has a detailed history of using irresponsible, false and accusatory rhetoric throughout Trump\\u2019s presidency, which is what this tweet simply documents in Schiff\\u2019s own words.\\u201d\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Schiff said the security of the congressman and his staff is \\u201calways a top priority,\\u201d declining to go into more detail about specific threats. A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police said authorities consult with individual congressional offices on \\u201csecurity-related matters\\u201d but declined to discuss precautions around the high-stakes impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe most graphic and specific threats against Schiff were quickly scrubbed from Twitter, whose policies prohibit threats of violence as well as the \\u201cglorification of violence.\\u201d At least one additional tweet was removed after it was flagged for the company by The Washington Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut much of the vitriol remained. And the violent language also reached beyond Twitter, echoing on platforms such as Facebook and 4chan, a sprawling online agora where hate speech and violent threats are routine. A link to an article about Trump\\u2019s accusation of treason against Schiff appearing on a Facebook page called \\u201cUSA Patriots for Donald Trump,\\u201d which boasts nearly 2 million followers, drew a slew of comments about the congressman being hanged.\\n\\nThe heightened focus on Schiff reflects the extent to which the former prosecutor and longtime Los Angeles-area congressman has become the b\\u00eate noire of the Trump movement since becoming the de facto head of the investigation of Trump\\u2019s efforts to enlist Ukraine\\u2019s help in damaging former vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. Schiff has come under criticism from Trump and congressional Republicans as they seek to delegitimize the inquiry by portraying it as tainted by political bias. The nub of the criticism of Schiff is that he spoofed the president\\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart during a congressional hearing and that he made misleading statements about the nature of his prior knowledge of the initial whistleblower complaint.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnalysts say the pattern resulting in the violent rhetoric targeting Schiff makes evident the radicalizing effect of social media, which Trump uses to incite his followers against his perceived enemies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cWhole online communities are forming around these sentiments, like MAGA,\\u201d said Amarnath Amarasingam, an expert on political violence and an assistant professor at Queen\\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, referring to Trump\\u2019s campaign slogan. \\u201cThe online social movement of Trump supporters is very real, and a cohort of that movement has come out and said they\\u2019re ready to take up arms when needed. This is something a few of us have been worried about for some time.\\u201d\\n\\nThe web is where the president\\u2019s hold over his supporters comes into sharpest focus, the extremism researcher said. On Twitter, his opinions \\u2014 and his disparaging views of other politicians \\u2014 are received uncritically, Amarasingam added, giving Trump enormous power over his followers and \\u201csetting the stage for violence.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome Trump critics have also used sharp language online, including accusing the president of treason and noting the maximum penalty: death.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death,\\u201d former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination, said last month on MSNBC of Trump\\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. The comment was tweeted by a reporter, and retweeted by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.).\\n\\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz,), who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt in 2011, said the responsibility of politicians to \\u201cseek the truth\\u201d and \\u201ctreat their fellow Americans with respect\\u201d was heightened \\u201cin charged times.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGlobally, public figures are not living up to that responsibility, said Jacob Davey, senior research manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a U.K.-based think tank dedicated to countering extremism and polarization. The result is increasing online radicalization \\u2014 not just in the Middle East and Northern Africa, long the focus of extremism research, but also in the heart of the West.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSocial media, he said, \\u201chas undoubtedly made engaging in such behavior easier than ever before, with users escaping the legal and social repercussions of their actions.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s ability to craft an alternate universe for his supporters, in which he is the victim of lawless Democrats, rests on an unregulated online ecosystem, where fake news travels faster than the truth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpanbauer, who became dissatisfied with Obama during his first term and voted for his Republican challenger in 2012, said she gets most of her news on Twitter and YouTube. Among those she trusts are Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity (\\u201cof course\\u201d) and Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch (\\u201cthank God for Tom Fitton\\u201d).\\n\\nTrump, she said, channels her anger at Washington, while speaking directly to his supporters. \\u201cIt\\u2019s wonderful, really, what Trump does on Twitter,\\u201d said Spanbauer, who has worked in retail and sales and struggles, along with her husband, to stay above the federal poverty line.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBeneath her verdict on Schiff\\u2019s fate, which she acknowledges was hyperbolic, lies a firm conviction that the congressman is guilty of treason.\\n\\nThe impeachment inquiry, she said, is a \\u201csupreme insult to our country.\\u201d Those leading it \\u201cshould be held accountable to the length of the law,\\u201d she added. \\u201cIt\\u2019s treason. It\\u2019s treason.\\u201d\",\n          \"At the center of the bloody rampage unfolding in the \\u201cChurch of Fake News\\u201d is a man dressed in a dark pinstripe suit. President Trump\\u2019s head is superimposed on his body.\\n\\nThe graphic images are from a fake video that was shown during a pro-Trump conference last week at the president\\u2019s hotel and golf resort near Miami, according to the New York Times, which first reported on the video\\u2019s existence Sunday night. The clip has since drawn intense backlash from journalists and public figures who have decried it as \\u201cvile and horrific\\u201d and an \\u201cincitement of violence.\\u201d Many of the news organizations and people featured in the video have been publicly targeted by Trump, who is frequently criticized for his inflammatory remarks and anti-media rhetoric.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cThis video isn\\u2019t funny,\\u201d tweeted former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\\u2019Rourke. \\u201cIt will get people killed.\\u201d\\n\\nAt a conference of Trump supporters, they played a video of our president murdering journalists in a church.

The site\\u2019s creator, a user known by his Internet handle, Carpe Donktum, scored an Oval Office meeting in July with Trump, who reportedly welcomed him as a \\u201cgenius.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCarpe Donktum confirmed in a Twitter message Sunday to The Washington Post that \\u201cThe creator of the video is, and will remain a contributor to my site MemeWorld.\\u201d Carpe Donktum declined to identify the video\\u2019s creator citing concerns that the person may face online or in-person harassment.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlex Phillips, organizer of the American Priority Festival and Conference, told the Times the video was played at one point during the three-day event that began Thursday as part of a \\u201cmeme exhibit.\\u201d The violent parody was included in a meme compilation that also featured Trump\\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign logo, according to the Times.\\n\\n\\u201cIt has come to our attention that an unauthorized video was shown in a side room at #AMPFest19,\\u201d a statement posted to the conference\\u2019s website said. \\u201cThis video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe statement went on to note that the conference \\u201calways has and always will condemn political violence.\\u201d\\n\\nPhillips told the Times the \\u201cmatter is under review.\\u201d\\n\\nIn a statement to The Post early Monday, the Trump campaign distanced itself from the video.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cThat video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence,\\u201d campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.\\n\\nPeople close to Trump, such as former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump Jr., were also scheduled to speak at the conference and told the Times they were not aware of the edited footage.\\n\\nThe video\\u2019s massacre scene opens with the Trump figure walking down the center aisle of a packed church. More than a dozen of the parishioners\\u2019 faces are covered by the logos of major media organizations, ranging from PBS to The Washington Post. Rising out of the pews when Trump passes them, some of the churchgoers appear to be yelling at the president, whose face contorts into a scowl.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the shouting intensifies, Trump abruptly stops walking and turns to face the angry mob. He pulls out a black gun from his jacket\\u2019s inside pocket and shoots a person edited to represent late actor Peter Fonda, who was a vocal critic of the president, in the head from point-blank range.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThen, chaos ensues.\\n\\nTrump takes down Bloomberg, Vox and \\u201cFake News\\u201d in quick succession before shooting Politico. At one point, he grabs someone who represents the Black Lives Matter movement in a chokehold and shoots that person in the head.\\n\\nAfter shooting MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Vice News, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Slate, Trump tries to shoot late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), but he is out of bullets. Instead, he uses his gun to deliver a vicious blow to the back of McCain\\u2019s neck.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe attack continues with Trump going after some of his most prominent detractors. He stabs actress and comedian Rosie O\\u2019Donnell and repeatedly punches Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He goes on to shoot MSNBC\\u2019s Mika Brzezinski and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), and later assaults Hillary Clinton with a gun.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe video comes to a dramatic end when Trump jams a sharp wooden stake through the head of a person whose face is a CNN logo. A now-grinning Trump appears to survey the carnage as DJ Khaled\\u2019s song, \\u201cAll I Do Is Win,\\u201d plays in the background. A pair of pixelated black sunglasses are lowered onto Trump\\u2019s face.\\n\\nBy late Sunday, \\u201cKingsman\\u201d was trending on Twitter with many expressing outrage at the video and calling on Trump to condemn it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cSadly, this is not the first time that supporters of the President have promoted violence against the media in a video they apparently find entertaining \\u2014 but it is by far and away the worst,\\u201d CNN said in a statement shared on Twitter.\\n\\nThe images in the recent video are \\u201cvile and horrific,\\u201d CNN said, adding, \\u201cThe President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhite House Correspondents\\u2019 Association President Jonathan Karl of ABC News also denounced the video, noting that Trump has been warned that \\u201chis rhetoric could incite violence.\\u201d\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWHCA Statement on video depicting President Trump murdering journalists. pic.twitter.com/52lHFaQjU2 \\u2014 WHCA (@whca) October 14, 2019\\n\\nKarl\\u2019s statement was supported early Monday by Cindy McCain, who tweeted that the images in the video of the president killing the media and her late husband \\u201cviolate every norm our society expects from its leaders.\\u201d\\n\\nTrump has made it a habit to publicly lambaste the media, individual journalists and his critics, leading to heightened concerns about safety. In 2017, the president was widely criticized for tweeting a similarly edited video that showed him body slamming a person with a CNN logo for a face during a pro wrestling match. Earlier this year, Cesar Sayoc, a devoted Trump supporter, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing 13 pipe bombs to high-profile Democrats, several of whom were featured in the recent video, and CNN.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Sunday, journalists and political commentators suggested the church video is further evidence that Trump\\u2019s words have influenced his supporters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\\u201cThis is an incitement to violence that didn\\u2019t just come from the dark corners of the Internet \\u2014 it was shown at a pro-Trump conference at one of his resorts,\\u201d tweeted Politico reporter Andrew Desiderio. \\u201cI\\u2019m speechless.\\u201d\\n\\nCNN commentator Ana Navarro-C\\u00e1rdenas wrote, \\u201cTrump has legitimized hate.\\u201d\\n\\nEnablers choose to deny it, but this is the kind of crap Trump peddles & inspires.

              "\"Contributing columnist\\n\\nThe House is on fire. And with each passing day, Donald Trump defiles the office of the president. If only past defrocked presidents could provide a roadmap for this firestorm.\\n\\nAndrew Johnson fought impeachment vigorously and survived removal, but never won reelection. Richard Nixon got in the way of justice, but eventually bowed to the rule of law, accepting his asterisk in the annals of history and resigning before certain removal. Bill Clinton expressed contrition, went on to complete his presidency with high approval ratings and has remained a popular former president.\\n\\nIf you care about democracy, the rule of law and nearly 250 years of constitutional governance, take heed. President Trump is no Clinton or Nixon, or even Johnson. He will not go quietly. It will be ugly. He will betray us and the rule of law in the process — defying subpoenas, withholding documents, blocking witnesses.\\n\\nThis presidency is fouled with disrespect for rules, boundaries and norms. Trump walked away from major agreements negotiated by his predecessors — the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate accord — and the United States’ word as bond is no more. Look at the ease with which he discards supporters — ask former attorney general Jeff Sessions or former secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Ask our allies, here today, gone tomorrow — NATO, the Kurds in Syria.\\n\\nFrom his earliest days as a candidate, Trump voiced appallingly arrogant views about the power of the presidency: “Mexico will pay for the wall!” ; “I alone can fix it”; “My primary consultant is myself.” His possessiveness over people and institutions is also not new: “my generals and my military,” “my African American.”\\n\\nOnly months into his presidency, Trump disparaged democratic allies, including Germany’s Angela Merkel (“ruining Germany”) and Britain’s Theresa May (“foolish”) — notably, both women — in favor of strong-arm leaders such as North Korea’s Kim Jong Un (who wrote him “beautiful letters”), Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman (“very good ally”), Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan (“great friendship”) and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte (“great relationship”). Trump heaps praise on Russia’s Vladimir Putin (“he’s a strong leader”). And, days after revealing his words pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on his opponent, he invited China to do it, too.\\n\\nTrump’s campaign for the White House was rotten from the beginning. We glimpsed its depths when his lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance felonies and identified Trump as “Individual 1” in a conspiracy to pay off an adult-film star and a former Playboy model to silence them during the height of the 2016 presidential campaign. We got even more evidence of Trump’s deception in the dense report prepared by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election to benefit Trump and try to defeat Hillary Clinton. Mueller laid the groundwork for at least 10 acts of obstruction of justice.\\n\\nEven with all of that, it’s this still-unraveling Ukraine story that makes clear the bits and pieces that we could only imagine with Trump’s pleas to “Russia, if you’re listening . . . .” We have the same threats, lies, subterfuge and obstruction — only this time, we have the president’s unambiguous words to Zelensky: “I would like you to do us a favor though.” Ukraine represents the same lawlessness that propelled Trump over the finish line in 2016: this time in plain sight, with witnesses, including at least one whistleblower and lots of bit players. From the State Department to the Energy Department to the Justice Department and throughout the White House, Trump is using every bit of the machinery of government and personnel at his disposal to strongarm a small country under the heel of its threatening Russian neighbor — all to get manufactured dirt on a political opponent.\\n\\nIt’s illegal. The evidence is bearing fruit. The time will come. And justice will be served.\\n\\nThe president’s personal approval rating remains low, though stable, but there is growing support for impeachment — a Fox News poll this week found that 51 percent support removing Trump from office. Independents, as well as Democrats, mostly support the impeachment inquiry, while Republicans are mostly holding tight. These things may or may not change.\\n\\nEither way, we will be changed if we do not right this ship of democracy.\\n\\n“Impeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.” We should heed these words, spoken by the 1999 version of Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). The fire did not start with Ukraine. Nonetheless, Ukraine may give us the water to finally put it out.\\n\\nRead more from Donna F. Edwards's archive.\""
